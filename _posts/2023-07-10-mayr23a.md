title: A Congruence-based Approach to Active Automata Learning from Neural Language
  Models
abstract: The paper proposes an approach for probably approximately correct active
  learning of probabilistic automata (PDFA) from neural language models. It is based
  on a congruence over strings which is parameterized by an equivalence relation over
  probability distributions. The learning algorithm is implemented using a tree data
  structure of arbitrary (possibly unbounded) degree. The implementation is evaluated
  with several equivalences on LSTM and Transformer-based neural language models from
  different application domains.
