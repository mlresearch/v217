title: Active Inference of Extended Finite State Models of Software Systems
abstract: Extended finite state machines (EFSMs) model stateful systems with internal
  data variables, and have many software engineering applications. It is possible
  to infer such models  by observing system behaviour. Still, existing approaches
  are either limited to classical FSM models with no internal data state, or implicitly
  require the ability to reset the system under inference, which may not always be
  possible. We present an extension to the hW-inference algorithm that can infer EFSM
  models, with input and output parameters as well as guards and internal registers
  and their data update functions, from systems without a reliable reset. For the
  problem to be tractable, we require some assumptions on the observability and determinism
  of the system. The main restriction is that the control flow of the system must
  be finite, although data types could be infinite.
