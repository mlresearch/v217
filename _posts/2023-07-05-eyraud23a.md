title: 'TAYSIR Competition: Transformer+\textscrnn: Algorithms to Yield Simple and
  Interpretable Representations'
abstract: 'This article presents the content of the competition Transformers+\textsc{rnn}:
  Algorithms to Yield Simple and Interpretable Representations (TAYSIR, the Arabic
  word for ‘simple’), which was an on-line challenge on extracting simpler models
  from already trained neural networks held in Spring 2023. These neural nets were
  trained on sequential categorial/symbolic data. Some of these data were artificial,
  some came from real world problems (such as Natural Language Processing, Bioinformatics,
  and Software Engineering). The trained models covered a large spectrum of architectures,
  from Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SRN) to Transformers, including Gated Recurrent
  Unit (GRU) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). No constraint was given on the surrogate
  models submitted by the participants: any model working on sequential data was accepted.
  Two tracks were proposed: neural networks trained on Binary Classification tasks,
  and on Language Modeling tasks. The evaluation of the surrogate models took into
  account both the simplicity of the extracted model and the quality of the approximation
  of the original model.'
