title: Identification of Substitutable Context-Free Languages over Infinite Alphabets
  from Positive Data
abstract: This paper is concerned with the identification in the limit from positive
  data of substitutable context-free languages \textsc{cfl}s) over infinite alphabets.
  citet{ClarkE07} showed that substitutable \textsc{cfl}s over finite alphabets are
  learnable in this learning paradigm. We show that substitutable \textsc{cfl}s generated
  by grammars whose production rules may have \emph{predicates} that represent sets
  of potentially infinitely many terminal symbols in a compact manner are learnable
  if the terminal symbol sets represented by those predicates are learnable, under
  a certain condition. This can be seen as a result parallel to citeauthor{ArgyrosDA2018}â€™s
  work (2018) that amplifies the query learnability of predicate classes to that of
  symbolic automata classes. Our result is the first that shows such amplification
  is possible for identifying some \textsc{cfl}s in the limit from positive data.
