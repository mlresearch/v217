title: 'A journey into the Generative AI and large language models: From NLP to BioInformatics'
abstract: In the last year, the generative AI field has seen a remarkable breakthrough,
  specifically the generative ai models and their applications in the natural language
  processing domain. It has achieved new state-of-the-art results on all public datasets
  and super human-level chatting capabilities. The backbone of this breakthrough is
  the large language models, including OpenAI GPT and Google Palm. The advantages
  of these large language models are that they can effectively capture the semantic,
  syntactic, grammar, and meaning of characters, words, and sentences from large unlabelled
  datasets using self-supervised learning. Later it can be used to represent sentences
  and documents better through embedding or as a zero/multi-shot learning method for
  many NLP tasks. Fortunately, these models have started to be leveraged in other
  fields like bioinformatics and biochemistry. This talk will give an overview of
  the large language models and how it was applied in the Bioinformatics field to
  boost the performance on many use cases. Furthermore, it will show how high-performance
  computing and optimized deep-learning software and libraries allowed these models
  to be faster and more efficient during training and inference.
