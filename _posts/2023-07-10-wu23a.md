title: String Extension Learning Despite Noisy Intrusions
abstract: We examine the conditions in which string extension learning algorithms
  are able to identify classes of formal languages in the limit from noisy data presentations
  in polynomial time.  A data presentation for a formal language $L$ is noisy if it
  contains words belonging to the complement of $L$. In the general case, string extensions
  learners cannot distinguish noise from true examples and are led astray. The main
  result is that relative frequencies can be used to distinguish noisy examples from
  true examples provided the data presentations are constrained to those in which
  relative frequencies are uniformly present and exceed the rate at which noise is
  introduced.
