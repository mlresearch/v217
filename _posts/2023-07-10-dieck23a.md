title: Learning Syntactic Monoids from Samples by extending known Algorithms for learning
  State Machines
abstract: 'For the inference of regular languages, most current methods learn a version
  of deterministic finite automata. Syntactic monoids are an alternative representation
  of regular languages, which have some advantages over automata. For example, traces
  can be parsed starting from any index and the star-freeness of the language they
  represent can be checked in polynomial time. But, to date, there existed no passive
  learning algorithm for syntactic monoids. In this paper, we prove that known state-merging
  algorithms for learning deterministic finite automata can be instrumented to learn
  syntactic monoids instead, by using as the input a special structure proposed in
  this paper: the interfix-graph. Further, we introduce a method to encode frequencies
  on the interfix-graph, such that models can also be learned from only positive traces.
  We implemented this structure and performed experiments with both traditional data
  and data containing only positive traces. As such this work answers basic theoretical
  and experimental questions regarding a novel passive learning algorithm for syntactic
  monoids.'
