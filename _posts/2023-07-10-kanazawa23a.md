title: Extending Distributional Learning from Positive Data and Membership Queries
abstract: We consider an extension of distributional learning of context-free languages
  (from positive data and membership queries), where nonterminals are represented
  by extended regular expressions (allowing all Boolean operations) augmented by atoms
  corresponding to membership queries. These nonterminals classify a string based
  not just on its distribution, but also on the distributions of its substrings. The
  learning algorithm for this extension works in essentially the same way as in previous
  works on distributional learning, while targeting a significantly larger class of
  context-free languages.
