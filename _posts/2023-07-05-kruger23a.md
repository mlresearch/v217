title: Lower Bounds for Active Automata Learning
abstract: We study lower bounds for the number of output and equivalence queries required
  for active learning of finite state machines, with a focus on $L^{#}$, a new learning
  algorithm that requires fewer queries for learning than other state-of-the-art algorithms
  on a large collection of benchmarks.  We improve the lower bound of cite{BalcazarDG97}
  on the combined number of output and equivalence queries required by any learning
  algorithm, and give a simpler proof. We prove that in the worst case $L^{#}$ needs
  $n-1$ equivalence queries to learn an FSM with $n$ states, and establish lower bounds
  on the number of output queries needed by $L^{#}$ in the worst case. In practical
  applications, the maximum length of the shortest separating sequence for all pairs
  of inequivalent states (MS3) is often just $1$ or $2$. We present $L^{#}_h$, a version
  of $L^{#}$ with bounded lookahead $h$, which learns FSMs with an MS3 of at most
  $h$ without requiring any equivalence queries, and give lower and upper bounds on
  its complexity.
