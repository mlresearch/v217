title: Formal and Empirical Studies of Counting Behaviour in ReLU RNNs
abstract: In recent years, the discussion about systematicity of neural network learning
  has gained renewed interest, in particular the formal analysis of neural network
  behaviour.  In this paper, we investigate the capability of single-cell ReLU RNN
  models to demonstrate precise counting behaviour.  Formally, we start by characterising
  the semi-Dyck-1 language and semi-Dyck-1 counter machine that can be implemented
  by a single Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) cell. We define three Counter Indicator
  Conditions (CICs) on the weights of a ReLU cell and show that fulfilling these conditions
  is equivalent to accepting the semi-Dyck-1 language, i.e. to perform exact counting.  Empirically,
  we study the ability of single-cell ReLU RNNs to learn to count by training and
  testing them on different datasets of Dyck-1 and semi-Dyck-1 strings.  While networks
  that satisfy the CICs count exactly and thus correctly even on very long strings,
  the trained networks exhibit a wide range of results and never satisfy the CICs
  exactly.  We investigate the effect of deviating from the CICs and find that configurations
  that fulfil the CICs are not at a minimum of the loss function in the most common
  setups.  This is consistent with observations in previous research indicating that
  training ReLU networks for counting tasks often leads to poor results.  We finally
  discuss implications of these results and possible avenues for improving network
  behaviour.
