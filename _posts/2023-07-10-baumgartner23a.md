title: 'Learning state machines from data streams: A generic strategy and an improved
  heuristic'
abstract: State machines models are models that simulate the behavior of discrete
  event systems, capable of representing systems such as software systems, network
  interactions, and control systems, and have been researched extensively. The nature
  of most learning algorithms however is the assumption that all data be available
  at the begining of the algorithm, and little research has been done in learning
  state machines from streaming data. In this paper, we want to close this gap further
  by presenting a generic method for learning state machines from data streams, as
  well as a merge heuristic that uses sketches to account for incomplete prefix trees.
  We implement our approach in an open-source state merging library and compare it
  with existing methods. We show the effectiveness of our approach with respect to
  run-time, memory consumption, and quality of results on a well known open dataset.
