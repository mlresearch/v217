title: 'A Procedure for Inferring a Minimalist Lexicon from an SMT Model of a Language
  Acquisition Device '
abstract: We introduce a constraint-based procedure for inferring a Minimalist Grammar
  (MG) that falls within the “Logic Grammar” framework. The procedure, implemented
  as a working computer program, takes as input an MG lexicon and a sequence of sentences
  paired with their semantic representation, and outputs an MG lexicon that is a superset
  of the input lexicon and that yields for each input sentence a syntatic structure
  encoding the associated semantic representation. The procedure operates by first
  constructing an SMT model of a language acquisition device that is constrained by
  the input lexicon and the (sentence, semantic-representation) pairs, and then using
  an SMT-solver to identify a model-solution in which the lexicon is optimized for
  parsimony. We show how the procedure can be used to form a computational model of
  a child language learner, presenting two experiments in which the procedure is used
  for instantaneous and incremental acquisition of an MG lexicon, and find that the
  optimal MG lexicons inferred by the procedure yield derivations that agree with
  the prescriptions of contemporary theories of minimalist syntax.
