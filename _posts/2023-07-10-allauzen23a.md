title: 'Weighted Finite Automata with Failure Transitions: Algorithms and Applications'
abstract: 'Weighted finite automata (WFA) are used in many applications including
  speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, computational biology,
  image processing, and optical character recognition. Such applications often have
  strict time and memory requirements, so efficient representations and algorithms
  are paramount. We examine one useful technique, the use of failure transitions,
  to represent automata compactly. A failure transition is taken only when no immediate
  match to the input is possible at a given state. Automata with failure transitions,
  initially introduced for string matching problems, have found wider use including
  compactly representing language, pronunciation, transliteration and semantic models.
  In this talk, we will address the extension of several weighted finite automata
  algorithms to automata with failure transitions ($\Phi$-WFAs). Efficient algorithms
  to intersect two $\Phi$-WFAs, to remove failure transitions, to trim, and to compute
  the shortest distance in a $\Phi$-WFA will be presented. We will demonstrate the
  application of some of these algorithms on two language modeling tasks: the distillation
  of arbitrary probabilistic models as weighted finite automata with failure transitions
  and the federated learning of n-gram language models. We will show the relevance
  of these methods to the privacy-preserving training of language models for virtual
  keyboard applications for mobile devices. This talk covers work in collaboration
  with Michael Riley, Ananda Theertha Suresh, Brian Roark, Vlad Schogol, Mingqing
  Chen, Rajiv Mathews, Adeline Wong, and Fran√ßoise Beaufays.'
