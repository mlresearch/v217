title: Detecting Changes in Loop Behavior for Active Learning
abstract: Active automaton learning is a popular approach for building models of software
  systems. The approach forms a hypothesis model from observations and then performs
  a heuristic equivalence query to check if the learned model is equal to the model
  under test. The current methods for equivalence queries, however often fail to find
  counterexamples when encountering loops, one of the most common control structures
  in software. We introduce two novel equivalence checkers that better handle loops.
  One extends the well-known W-Method, and the other uses symbolic execution. Both
  methods are tested on RERS challenge problems. We show that our approaches find
  more counterexamples on suitable problems and thus learn more accurate models. We
  further test our symbolic execution approach outside active learning and show that
  it finds more errors than the state-of-the-art method Klee on several problems.
