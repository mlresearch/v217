title: Testing-based Black-box Extraction of Simple Models from RNNs and Transformers
abstract: In this technical report, we outline the testing-based black-box method
  used to extract simple and interpretable models from RNNs and transformers. Our
  work was done in the scope of the TAYSIR competition, in which it won the first
  place.
