title: Learning of Regular Languages by Recurrent Neural Networks? (Mainly Questions)
abstract: Recurrent neural network architectures were introduced over 30 years ago.
  From the start attention focused on their performance at learning regular languages
  using some variant of gradient descent. This talk reviews some of the history of
  that research, includes some empirical observations, and emphasizes questions to
  which we still seek answers.
