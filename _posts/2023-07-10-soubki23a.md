title: Benchmarking State-Merging Algorithms for Learning Regular Languages
abstract: The state-merging algorithms RPNI, EDSM, and ALERGIA are tested on MLRegTest,
  a benchmark for the learning of regular languages citep{heinz-etal-2022-mlregtest}.
  MLRegTest contains training, development, and test data for 1,800 regular languages,
  which themselves are from several well-studied subregular classes. The results show
  that there is large variation in the performance of these algorithms on the benchmark
  with EDSM performing the best overall. Furthermore, the mean accuracies on the test
  data for all three state-merging algorithms are less than the mean accuracies obtained
  by the neural networks citet{heinz-etal-2022-mlregtest} studied. A further experiment
  augments the training data in MLRegtest with shorter strings and shows they dramatically
  improve the performance of the state-merging algorithms.
