title: 'fAST: regular expression inference from positive examples using Abstract Syntax
  Trees'
abstract: 'Our paper presents a new algorithm that infers a regular expression matching
  a given set of strings known as \emph{positive examples}\footnote{Positive (resp.
  negative) examples are strings that do (resp. do not) belong to the target language.}.  This
  algorithm has practical applications in automating file parsing for files with an
  unknown template.  In practice, prior works hardly apply because they require negative
  examples and hardly scale. By restricting to positive examples, the problem becomes
  especially challenging: many regular expressions can match the set of positive examples,
  but only a few are useful in practice.  To assess the quality of a regular expression,
  we introduce two performance metrics, called accuracy and conciseness.  The contributions
  of the paper are threefold. First, we introduce an algorithm that infers a regular
  expression from positive examples only while optimizing accuracy and conciseness.
  Second, we adapt this algorithm to generate a regular expression based on a set
  of predefined patterns. Third, we demonstrate the tractability and the usefulness
  of our solution by performing experiments on synthesized and real-world datasets.'
